QHttpHeader for Qt 5
--------------------

REASON
------
Starting Qt 5 all QHttp and QHttpHeader classes were deprecated. The QHttp class
deprecation is fully understandable and reasonable. But QHttpHeader classes deprecation
is completely unacceptable for me.

This is a description provided by Digia (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/sourcebreaks.html#changes-to-qt-network)
    The QHttp, QHttpHeader, QHttpResponseHeader, and QHttpRequestHeader
    classes are removed. Use QNetworkAccessManager instead.

Hey, guys, it sounds like "steering will is removed from your car. Use car instead."

DESCRITION
----------
So this is very fast (10 minutes) and dirty QHttpHeader classes porting to Qt5. The follow
classes are included:
    QHttpHeader
    QHttpRequestHeader
    QHttpResponseHeader

INSTALLATION
------------
    qmake
    make
    make install
Note that default destination is /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include
Change DEST variable in http_headers.pro in order to change that.

USAGE
-----
Use
    #include <http_headers.h>
instead of
    #include <QHttpHeaders>

All other usage is identical to Qt 4
