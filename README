QHttpHeader for Qt 5

Starting Qt 5 all QHttp and QHttpHeader classes were deprecated. The QHttp class
deprecation is fully understandable and reasonable. But QHttpHeader classes deprecation
is completely unacceptable for me.

This is a description provided by Digia (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/sourcebreaks.html#changes-to-qt-network)
    The QHttp, QHttpHeader, QHttpResponseHeader, and QHttpRequestHeader
    classes are removed. Use QNetworkAccessManager instead.

Hey, guys, it sounds like "steering will is removed from your car. Use car instead."

So this is very fast (10 minutes) and dirty QHttpHeader classes porting to Qt5. The follow
classes are included:
    QHttpHeader
    QHttpRequestHeader
    QHttpResponseHeader

Just
    qmake
    make
    make install
and the library is ready for use. Use "#include <http_headers.h>" instead of  "#include <QHttpHeaders>"
All other usage is identical to Qt 4
